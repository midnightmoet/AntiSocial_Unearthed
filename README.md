### AntiSocial MERN Social Media App    

This code is for the AntiSocial MERN social media app. It allows users to create accounts, post updates, and interact with other users.
 
The app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and includes features such as authentication, authorization, and real-time updates.

The code is organized into separate folders for the client and server, with each folder containing its own dependencies and configuration files.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- Express
- React.js
- Node.js
- Vite



## To run the app: 
- Navigate to the root directory and run "npm install" to install the dependencies, then run "npm run dev" to start the development server.

- Start nodemon with by running "npx nodemon" in the terminal


## Frontend
- Start with `npm run dev` in the clientside folder
- Running on port 5173
- Clientside was bootstrapped with create-react-app (I used 17.0.02 version)

## Backend
- Start with `npx nodemon` in the server folder
- Benefits of nodemon: automatically restarts the server when changes are made and catches errors immediately in terminal
- Running on port 3001
- Server is built with Node.js and Express
